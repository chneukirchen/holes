HOLES(1)                    General Commands Manual                   HOLES(1)

NAME
     holes – find runs of zero bytes

SYNOPSIS
     holes [-n minlen] [files ...]

DESCRIPTION
     holes looks for runs of zero bytes (a.k.a. holes) in the specified input
     files (or the standard input), and prints the start adresses (in
     hexadecimal) as well as the lengths (in decimal).  When multiple input
     files are specified, holes prefixes each line with the file name.

     By default, only holes of at least 64 bytes are reported.  This can be
     changed using the -n option.

EXIT STATUS
     The holes utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     fallocate(1), truncate(1), virt-sparsify(1)
